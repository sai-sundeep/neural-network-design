Dive into the fundamentals of neural networks with my comprehensive repository, covering the design, implementation, and training of various architectures including multi-layer perceptrons, Adaline networks, radial basis networks, and self-organizing feature maps. Understand essential training algorithms such as the LMS Algorithm, backpropagation and its variants, competitive learning, and the Kohonen rule. Visualize performance surfaces and optimize network performance using steepest descent methods. The projects feature real-world and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the practical application and effectiveness of neural networks across diverse domains.
